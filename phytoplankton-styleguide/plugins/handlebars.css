/*
# Example usage

Wrap your code with
[fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown#fenced-code-blocks) `` ``` `` +
`hbs`, like this:

	```handlebars
	{ "template": "hello", "context": "filtertabs" }
	```

Phytoplankton will automatically render the code as both HTML and the code blocks (uncompiled and compiled Handlebars) with syntax highlighting.

```handlebars
{ "template": "hello", "context": "filtertabs" }
```
