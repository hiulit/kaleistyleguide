# Phytoplankton - Living Style Guide

Generate a living style guide with your own CSS!

This project aims at making sure your style sheets are fully documented whilst being synchronized with your project styles.

To do this, it actually uses your style sheets so that, at anytime, you can review how your style guide looks.

*/
/*
# Main goals and benefits

* Fully documented CSS - No need to explain the benefits.
* No dependencies, simply download the repository and run it in your browser.
* Automatic generation of demo UI components.
* Easy access for anyone: designers, developers, managers, users, etc.
* Rapid development of projects by allowing developers to find the correct CSS and HTML for any given UI component.
* Open sourced so that all great ideas can be included.

# Installation

**No** Node.js, **no** Grunt, **no** Gulp, **no** nothing...

Just:

1. [Download](https://github.com/hiulit/kaleistyleguide) the repository or `git clone https://github.com/hiulit/kaleistyleguide.git`
2. Serve it on a HTTP server (or a local environment using [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/),
 [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/), etc.)
3. And it should work! ðŸ˜€

# Prepocessors support

* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) ([libsass v3.1.0](https://github.com/sass/libsass/releases/tag/3.1.0))
* [Less](http://lesscss.org/) ([v2.3.0](https://github.com/less/less.js/releases/tag/v2.3.0))
* [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) [v0.54.5](https://github.com/stylus/stylus/releases/tag/0.54.5)

So you don't have to ever use again a preprocessor tool ðŸ˜‰

## Notes

Why don't you use the [latest version of Sass](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_CHANGELOG.html)?

Phytoplankton uses [sass.js](https://github.com/medialize/sass.js) for having Sass in the browser
([not a trivial task](http://blog.rodneyrehm.de/archives/33-libsass.js-An-Emscripten-Experiment.html), btw)
which in turn uses [libsass](https://github.com/hcatlin/libsass).

**Update 1**: Here it is the the [State of Libsass (versus Ruby Sass)](http://www.solitr.com/blog/2014/01/state-of-libsass/).

**Update 2**: Here it is [The LibSass Compatibility Plan](https://github.com/sass/libsass/wiki/The-LibSass-Compatibility-Plan).

*It seems that finally, thanks to the effort of a lot of people, libsass will reach parity with Ruby Sass*.
