# Example Usage

It's pretty simple.

Wrap your code with
[fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown#fenced-code-blocks) `` ``` `` +
`language code`, like this:

	```markup
	<section>
		<h1>Heading</h1>
		<p>Bunch of awesome content</p>
	</section>
	```

Phytoplankton will automatically render the code as both HTML and the code block with syntax highlighting.

```markup
<section>
	<h1>Heading</h1>
	<p>Bunch of awesome content</p>
</section>
```

*/
/*
# More languages

Prism comes with a bunch of languages, such as:

* Markup (HTML) - *This is the only language that will render something.*
* CSS
* SCSS
* JavaScript
* Handlebars
* PHP
* Python
* Ruby

...and many more.

Just add the language after the `` ``` `` and you're good to go.

## Markup (HTML)

```markup
<section>
	<h1>Heading</h1>
	<p>Bunch of awesome content</p>
</section>
```

## CSS (or SCSS)

```scss
@mixin silly-links {
	a {
		color: blue;
		background-color: red;
	}
}

@include silly-links;
```

## JavaScript (or jQuery)

```javascript
function showValues() {
	var str = $( "form" ).serialize();
	$( "#results" ).text( str );
}
$( "input[type='checkbox'], input[type='radio']" ).on( "click", showValues );
$( "select" ).on( "change", showValues );
showValues();
```

Take a look at the [Prism's download page](http://prismjs.com/download.html)
for the full list of languages.

*As mentioned before, Prism comes with all the languages in the list.*

/*
# Plugins

Prism comes with:

* [Line Numbers](http://prismjs.com/plugins/line-numbers/)
* [Autolinker](http://prismjs.com/plugins/autolinker/)
* [WebPlatform Docs](http://prismjs.com/plugins/wpd/)
* [File Highlight](http://prismjs.com/plugins/file-highlight/)
* [Show Language](http://prismjs.com/plugins/show-language/)

## Line Numbers

It adds line number at the beginning of code lines.

It will only add the numbers when using [fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown#fenced-code-blocks) `` ``` `` +
`language code`. Not when using inline code.

## Autolinker

URLs and emails will be linked automatically.

```javascript
underscore: 'libs/underscore/underscore-min', // https://github.com/amdjs
backbone: 'libs/backbone/backbone-min', // https://github.com/amdjs
```

## WebPlatform Docs

Makes tokens link to [WebPlatform.org documentation](http://docs.webplatform.org/).

*Tip: Hover over the CSS properties.*

```css
div {
	width: 150px;
	height: 150px;
	margin: 1rem;
	float: left;
}

p {
	padding: 2rem;
}
```

## File Highlight

Use the `data-src` attribute on an empty `<pre>` element, like so:

	<pre data-src="js/main.js"></pre>

This renders Phytoplankton's `main.js`.

<pre data-src="js/main.js"></pre>

It also can render HTML.

This is Phytoplankton's `index.html`.

<pre data-src="index.html"></pre>

And if something goes wrong...

<pre data-src="wtf.html"></pre>

## Show Language

As you should have been already realized, it displays the highlighted language in code blocks (inline code does not show the label).

No need for more examples, right? Just sit back, relax and enjoy 😉

# Caution! ⚠️

Phytoplankton is bundled with a modified version of Prism due to **plugins** added to it.

The modifications are mostly just comments to clarify stuff but some are **features** added on it.

If you want to add/remove some of Prism's plugins or change the highlighting syntax theme, look for...

	// This is a "feature" that doesn't
	// come with the default plugin.

... before touching anything.
