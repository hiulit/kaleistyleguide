# Kalei ♥ Markdown

One of the great things about Kalei is that you can use the same style sheets you're using right now in your project.
How cool is that, right?

You just need to comment your style sheets using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
and then, boom!! The magic happens!

You end up with a **fully documented style sheet and a beautifully auto-generated living style guide**.
Killing two (tofu) birds with one stone.
What a deal!

Kalei uses [marked.js](https://github.com/chjj/marked) as the Markdown parser, and by default, it has
[GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown)](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) enabled.
So go ahead and [master your Markdown](http://guides.github.com/overviews/mastering-markdown/).

*/
/*
# Getting Started

By default, Kalei uses `imports.css` as a base style sheet to point at all the style sheets that you want to document.

This is how this particular `imports.css` looks like:

<pre data-src="css/imports.css"></pre>

## Config.js

There are 3 ways (well, actually 2) to point at your style sheets:

1. `css_path` - This is, by far, the best way to go and the one that Kalei uses by default.
2. `css_path_url` - **Not supported yet!!!**
3. `css_paths` - Manually enter an array of files.

Just comment and uncomment the appropiate lines to make it work.

<pre data-src="js/config.js"></pre>

Either way, Kalei **automatically creates a menu** out of your style sheets.

*/
/*
# Comments

Comment your style sheets like you would normally do, starting with `/ *` and ending with`* /`.

Each comment will become a new section.

*/
/*
# Headings

The `<h1>` (or `#` in Markdown) of the comment will become the title of the section.
And this title will appear in the left menu as a section's title.

The rest of the headings won't appear as sections of the menu.

*/
/*
# Code blocks

You can write you code indented with 1 tab (or 4 spaces) to show it as a code block, like this one:

	I'm a code block! Indented with 1 tab (or 4 spaces)

*/
/*
# Syntax highlighter

*Kalei uses [Prism](http://prismjs.com/) as the syntax highlighter. See more at [plugins/prism.scss](#/plugins/prism.scss)*.

Wrap your code with
[fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown#fenced-code-blocks) `` ``` `` +
`language code`, like this:

	```scss
	@mixin silly-links {
		a {
			color: blue;
			background-color: red;
		}
	}

	@include silly-links;
	```

And you'll get this:

```scss
@mixin silly-links {
	a {
		color: blue;
		background-color: red;
	}
}

@include silly-links;
```

Unlike code blocks, there's no need for indentation using the syntax highlighter.

*/
/*
# Rendering HTML

Wrap your code with
[fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown#fenced-code-blocks) `` ``` `` +
`markup`, like this:

	```markup
	<section>
		<h1>Heading</h1>
		<p>Bunch of awesome content</p>
	</section>
	```

Kalei will automatically render the code as both HTML and the code block with syntax highlighting.

```markup
<section>
	<h1>Heading</h1>
	<p>Bunch of awesome content</p>
</section>
```

*/
/*
# Kalei styles

To make sure that the rendered code of your style sheets is unaffected by Kalei's styles,
and vice versa, Kalei wraps all your CSS in `.code-render`.

These styles are appended at the end of `<div class="kalei-page">` so they rank at the top of the
[specificity wars](http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/css_specificity_wars.html).

```
<div class="kalei-page">
	<section class="kalei-page__item"></section>
	<section class="kalei-page__item"></section>
	<section class="kalei-page__item"></section>
	<style>
		.code-render {
			.whatever {
				color: red;
			}
		}
	</style>
</div>
```
